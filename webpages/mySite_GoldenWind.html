		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><strong>Giorno Giovanna</strong> is the human son of Dio Brando who retains the
			Joestar bloodline as Dio was in possession of Jonathan Joestar's
			body at the time Giorno was conceived, originally named Haruno
			Shiobana before moving to Italy. Giorno aspires to overthrow the
			Passione mafia's boss and rework the organization into one that
			helps the Italian people, akin to Robin Hood's band, in contrast
			to the sheer powerlust of its current leader, Diavolo.
			He uses the Stand <em>Gold Experience</em>, which has the ability to
			imbue things with life. After piercing his Stand with the arrow,
			it turns into <em>Gold Experience Requiem</em>, a Stand that reverts actions
			and willpower back to the state of "zero", completely nullifying them
			and preventing them from becoming "real" (whether stand or non-stand),
			effectively controlling causality, specifically keeping "cause" and
			removing "effect". It keeps his life-giving abilities but evolves it
			into a greater extent, with its strength and speed rivaling, if not
			higher, than Star Platinum or The World.</p>

			<p><strong>Bruno Bucciarati</strong> is the caporegime of a gang within Passione.
			He uses the Stand, <em>Sticky Fingers</em>, which can place a zipper on any object,
			allowing entrance into it. Bruno can also use <em>Sticky Fingers</em> to separate
			objects into smaller objects which can be zipped back together later and repaired.</p>

				<p><strong>Leone Abbacchio</strong> is a former police officer, and a member of Bucciarati's gang.
				He uses the Stand, <em>Moody Blues</em>, which can replay past history as a 3D
				video recording which he and others can observe during a replay of the events,
				although doing so leaves it temporarily defenseless.</p>

			<p><strong>Guido Mista</strong> is a member of Bucciarati's gang. He uses a revolver in tandem
			with his Stand, <em>Sex Pistols</em>, which is composed of six small humanoids who
			can control the bullets Mista shoots. The humanoids are numbered #1â€“#7,
			with no #4, due to Mista's tetraphobia. Each of the pistols which make up
			Mista's stand have their own individual personalities and internal conflicts
			which Mista always tries to resolve.</p>

			<p><strong>Pannacotta Fugo</strong> is Bucciarati's right-hand man in the gang. Fugo tends to
			be erratic in mood, often breaking into short bursts of rage. He uses
			the Stand, <em>Purple Haze</em>, which can release a virus that rapidly devours
			organic matter. <em>Purple Haze</em> is indiscriminate in how its virus affects people,
			damaging both friends and enemies alike (including Fugo himself).
			Because of Purple Haze's dangerous ability, Fugo tends to avoid using it
			until he runs out of other options in a fight.</p>

			<p><strong>Trish Una</strong> is the daughter of Passione's boss, and is on the run from rival factions
			within the mafia, such as the Hitman Team who wish to use her family ties to the
			Boss to track him down. She uses the Stand, <em>Spice Girl</em>, which can increase objects'
			elasticity, making them nearly indestructible.</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><strong>Jean Pierre Polnareff</strong> is a French swordsman who traveled alongside Jotaro Kujo and
			Joseph Joestar to defeat Giorno's father in 1988. Polnareff discovered the true identity
			of Passione's boss while investigating the rise of drug-related crimes in his home country,
			but was severely injured and left for dead after being overwhelmed by the boss' Stand.
			He contacts Bucciarati's team after they betray the boss and offers them a way to
			defeat the boss: a unique Stand Arrow (an object introduced in <em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em>)
			that gives whoever uses it a completely new Stand ability. Polnareff wields the
			extremely fast sword-wielding Stand, <em>Silver Chariot</em>, but when Diavolo forced
			Polnareff's <em>Silver Chariot</em> to use the Stand Arrow on <em>Sliver Chariot</em>, his Stand
			evolves into <em>Chariot Requiem</em>, which has the ability to swap the souls of living beings.</p>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><strong>Diavolo</strong> is the boss of Passione, and the father of Trish, intending to kill her to keep
			his existence a secret, targeting Giorno's group after they refused to hand Trish over.
			Diavolo uses the incredibly powerful Stand, <em>King Crimson</em>, which has the power to
			partially affect the causality of the near future in relation to himself; allowing him
			to negate processes, leaving only their consequences. Activating its power causes a
			time skip, where everything except Diavolo and <em>King Crimson</em> is changed to be in the
			state they would have been a few seconds later; for example, a bullet that would
			have hit Diavolo will suddenly be shifted to be on his other side. Diavolo is
			able to predict what will happen during the timeskip by using <em>King Crimson's</em>
			second face, <em>Epitaph</em>; this sub-power can also be used by Doppio to see seconds
			into the future.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><strong>Vinegar Doppio</strong> is the Boss' younger, more innocent and eccentric underboss.
			As a member of Passione, he thinks of himself as the most loyal subordinate to
			Diavolo, but in reality, the two are separate souls inhabiting the same body.
			During the course of the Part, he helps Diavolo to act and move around undetected.
			It is ambiguous whether Doppio is truly a Stand User, but he is allowed to
			wield both <em>King Crimson's</em> arms and <em>Epitaph</em> in battle.</p>
