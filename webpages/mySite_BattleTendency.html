			<p><strong>Joseph Joestar</strong> is the main protagonist and grandson of Jonathan Joestar.
			Like Jonathan, he can use Hamon, though he is not initially as skilled in its
			use as Jonathan was. He initially uses a pair of Hamon-empowered clackers in battle,
			but he relies more on his wits than brute strength in fights, employing his uncanny
			ability to predict his opponent's actions down to what they will say next. Joseph
			makes return appearances in <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> and <em>Diamond Is Unbreakable</em>.</p>

				<p><strong>Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli</strong> is a suave ladies' man and the grandson of Jonathan
				Joestar's teacher Will A. Zeppeli. He is rather cool and collected, especially
				compared to Joseph, with whom he is grudgingly paired to fight the Pillar Men.
				But over time, Joseph starts to grow on him so much that he is able to understand
				his strange thought patterns and they form an unbeatable duo. He infuses the
				Hamon into soap bubbles he creates with his specially-made gloves. Caesar
				dies near the end, in way like his grandfather, giving Joesph the last of
				his "Hamon" to help him defeat the rest of the pillar men.</p>

				<p><strong>Rudol von Stroheim</strong> is the commander of the Nazi forces who discovered Santana

				<p><strong>The Pillar Men</strong> are from a race of ancient, humanoid, super-human beings.
				These beings are now nearly extinct, but used to live hundreds of thousand of
				years ago in the American continent. They are highly intelligent, extremely strong,
				and able to manipulate their bodies to a very fine degree; however, they are
				vulnerable to the rays of the Sun and to the Ripple.<br><br>
				The four remaining representatives of this species in the world are <em>Kars</em>,
				<em>Esidisi</em>, <em>Wamuu</em>, and <em>Santana</em>, in descending order of hierarchy, now called
				"Pillar Men" since they were discovered sleeping inside stone pillars.
				Led by Kars, this group awakens in 1938 to continue seeking out the Red Stone of
				Aja, which, combined with their technology of the Stone Mask, will transform them into
				"ultimate beings" immune even to the Sun. </p>
