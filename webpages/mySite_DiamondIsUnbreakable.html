				<p><strong>Josuke Higashikata</strong> is the main protagonist and illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar.
				He is a freshman who lives in the town of Morioh with his mother and grandfather.
				He uses the Stand <em>Crazy Diamond</em>, which can not only punch rapidly, but also restore
				objects to their original state or rearrange their structure, allowing him to heal injuries,
				erase written documents, or revert complex structures to their raw components.
				He becomes especially enraged if anyone ever makes fun of his pompadour hairstyle.</p>

				<p><strong>Koichi Hirose</strong> is Josuke's and Okuyasu's best friend and is also a freshman in high school,
				but appears as a short boy. His Stand is <em>Echoes</em>, which has three distinct "ACTs".
				ACT 1 and ACT 2 can replicate sound effects and attach them to anything,
				which result in that happening to the object (e.g. attaching the word "whoosh" causes a
				gust of wind to blow by) while ACT 3 loses the former abilities and gains the ability
				"3-Freeze" which causes a target to become very heavy.</p>

					Higashikata and Koichi Hirose after defeating a Stand user who murdered his brother.
					His Stand <em>The Hand</em>, swipes with its right hand which erases whatever it swipes and it
					can be used to erase space, drawing objects closer to Okuyasu.</p>

				investigate the crimes of a Stand user. His Stand <em>Star Platinum: The World</em> has
				the ability to stop the flow of time temporarily.</p>

				<p><strong>Rohan Kishibe</strong> is a famous manga artist who recently moved into a house in Morioh.
				His Stand <em>Heaven's Door</em>, allows him to temporarily turn a person into a book,
				with all of their memories written down akin to a novel. Rohan can read the memories,
				learn their weaknesses and secrets, as well as write down commands that they must follow
				(usually, "Can not attack Rohan Kishibe.") The power only activates when the target
				sees Rohan's drawn artwork, but can also activate if Rohan draws something in the
				air with his finger. Rohan also stars in his own spin-off one-shot series by Araki
				called Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan.</p>
